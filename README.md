# Wind-driven_variability_of_mCDW_paper_code_library
This is the repository for the code used to produce the figures displayed in the manuscript "Wind-driven variability of modified Circumpolar Deep Water intrusions into Vincennes Bay, East Antarctica.": [add link once published.]
The code for processing, investigating, testing, analysis and all the research work done prior to the publishing of this paper can be provided by request. However, it isn't very organized or easy to follow. It is a direct copy of my repository and a testment to the worst coding practices that I follow. If you have trouble looking for something specific - because you will have trouble if you try - please contact me again. 

The links for downloading the data are on the Open Research section of the manuscript.
